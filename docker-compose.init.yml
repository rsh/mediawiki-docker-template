# MediaWiki - Initial Setup Configuration
#
# Use this file for first-time setup when LocalSettings.php doesn't exist yet
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.init.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
#
# After completing the MediaWiki installation wizard and downloading LocalSettings.php:
#   1. Place LocalSettings.php in instance/LocalSettings.php
#   2. Stop: docker-compose down
#   3. Start normally: docker-compose up -d (this will use the regular config with LocalSettings.php mounted)

services:
  mediawiki:
    volumes:
      # Override the LocalSettings.php mount from base config
      # Only mount images directory during initial setup
      - ./instance/images:/var/www/html/images
